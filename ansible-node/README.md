# Ansible Node
Creates a container which can be managed with Ansible.

The goal of this container is to provide a practice environment for Ansible and Ansible Tower workshops.

This is not designed for production use.

# Change SSH Keys!
These keys are placed here for convenience. You should generate your own and not use these for your containers.

# Change Root Password!
The root password is statically set. You should modify the Dockerfile and change it to something more secure.
